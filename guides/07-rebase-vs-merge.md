# Rebase versus merge

## Purpose

Choose history integration based on whether commit sequence or pull-request atomicity is the primary evidence.

## Invariants

- The change must remain independently reviewable and reversible.
- Repository authority stays in the upstream review and merge boundary.
- Authorship, verification evidence, and resulting history remain explicit.

## Verification

Review the branch diff against upstream, confirm the intended contract is represented accurately, and verify the final commit attribution before merge.
